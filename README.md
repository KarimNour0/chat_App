# chat

Welcome to our chat application!

This app provides a seamless communication experience for our users with a simple and intuitive interface. To get started, you will need to create an account by registering with your email and a secure password. If you already have an account, you can log in using your credentials.

Our chat app is powered by Firebase, which ensures real-time communication and synchronization between devices. This means that you can stay connected with your friends and family no matter where you are in the world.

Once you are logged in, you will be taken to the chat screen where you can view your contacts and start chatting with them. You can create new chats, send and receive messages, and even share media such as photos and videos.
